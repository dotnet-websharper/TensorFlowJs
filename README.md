# WebSharper TensorFlow.js Binding

This repository provides an F# [WebSharper](https://websharper.com/) binding for [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), enabling seamless integration of machine learning models into WebSharper projects for browser-based AI and ML applications.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of two main projects:

1. **Binding Project**:
   - Contains the F# WebSharper binding for TensorFlow.js.

## Features

- WebSharper bindings for TensorFlow.js.
- Easy integration of machine learning models in WebSharper web applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.
- Node.js and npm (for building web assets).
- WebSharper tools.
- TensorFlow.js installed via npm (`npm i @tensorflow/tfjs`).

## Why Use TensorFlow.js

TensorFlow.js enables developers to:

1. **Run Models in the Browser**: Leverage client-side computation for AI tasks.
2. **Train Models Client-Side**: Train machine learning models directly in the browser.
3. **Accelerate Applications**: Use WebGL and WebAssembly for high-performance computation.
4. **Improve User Privacy**: Process sensitive data locally without sending it to a server.

Integrating TensorFlow.js with WebSharper allows F# developers to create powerful, browser-based AI applications seamlessly.
